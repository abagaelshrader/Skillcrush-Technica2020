# Skillcrush-Technica2020
Skillcrush team site for Technica 2020 Hackathon

Our site aims to help provide steps to work through a panic or anxiety attack.

We will establish a static, one-page site that will help users calm their mind, body, and breath using proven techniques.  The site will also link to additional resources to further help the user.
